Our database is a collection of data simulating a hospital's database. This database includes information about the hospitals (name, ID, location, etc.), employee information, patient information, and medication information. The purpose of this database and its associated website is to give doctors/hospital employees the ability to quickly look up information about anything they might need, as well as to easily look up specific things from the database, including things like specific medications for patients, the amount of health care providers in each hospital, etc. There were no ethical, legal, or security issues presented with this database, as all info is only given to authorized users in the hospital.
